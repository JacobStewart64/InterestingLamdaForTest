# InterestingLamdaForTest
lambda_for === for loop

it's not really a lambda, just function pointer

turned out when lambda pointer converted to function pointer, the executable grew in size from all the lambda crap still =0

seems barely useful, kinda annoying to use maybe. Possibility of code reuse could be neat.
